## Introduction

With the economics job market applications drawing to a close and
interviews drawing nearer, I want to highlight some aspects of
interviews that it appears to me may *not* be obvious to some
candidates. To be clear, none of these comments reflect on any specific
candidates I have interviewed. Rather, through chatting with PhD
students and folks on the market, I realized that there may be lack of
knowledge about certain kinds of interview questions, about approaches
to aspects of the interview itself, and about what interview panelists
are looking for. I approach this from the perspective of a “teaching
specialist” at a large institution where our teaching load is roughly
that of a 2-2 or 2-3 instructor and I believe many of these points
transfer directly to liberal arts colleges (I worked at one and
interviewed people there) and some of the comments also transfer to
research-focused positions where you’re expected to do teaching.

## My advice

1.  Don’t assume all members of the committee have read your JMP. At
    least one will have, but you can’t assume all members of the panel
    know your research well, if at all.

2.  Therefore practice explaining your research to *non-specialists*. If
    there are important ideas someone needs to know to understand what
    you do in your field, try to explain those ideas as you would to an
    economist who is interested in what you do, but doesn’t know. Do not
    assume the panel is going to know an abstruse part of environmental
    economics. development, or behavioral economics. Many don’t. Don’t
    make your interviewers feel stupid. (I mention these fields as I’ve
    done work in them and so I could make this mistake, they’re just
    placeholders) 

3.  I will often ask you, “How would you explain \[X\] in your JMP”, or
    “how would you explain your JMP to an interested undergraduate?” Or
    “How would you *change* the explanation you just gave to me \[aka
    someone with a PhD in economics\] if I asked you to explain it to an
    engaged undergraduate student?” Why would you make that change?
    Sometimes your original explanation will have been sufficiently
    clear that you don’t need to change it much, but more often than not
    it includes some higher-level understanding that a student may not
    have. You should feel free to ask a follow up such as, “Can I assume
    a student has done intermediate micro?” And I’ll say, “yes, go
    ahead.” And you could say something like, “My paper builds on the
    ideas of market failure and externalities that you would have
    learned about…” or similar. This shows that you situate what you do
    in what a student will understand and that you are trying to get
    around the [*curse of
    knowledge*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge).

4.  When people ask questions about your JMP or research, realize that
    they will be evaluating *how* you answer questions not only for how
    *smart* you are or how well you know your topic, but for *whether
    you could teach* that topic to students. Do you treat the questioner
    with respect? Do you take time to clarify what they asked (which
    especially with zoom lag and crappy mics may be helpful)? Do you
    answer with clarity and care?

5.  Read your audience. Don’t ramble when you answer a question. Pay
    attention to non-verbal cues you receive.

6.  Consider leaving a gap for questions at specific points and ask your
    audience/interviewers “Do you have any (follow-up) questions about
    X?”

7.  Have a syllabus or course outline prepared for a course in your
    field you would like to teach. I expect a graduating PhD to be able
    to teach almost any UG core course, but I’m likely to ask them “what
    would you like to teach \[in your field\] and how would you design
    that course?” This doesn’t have to be the actual syllabus you’d use
    for a course, but it helps to have sketched out for yourself an
    outline of topics and maybe a choice of textbook or some papers that
    you think are important. If you can’t do this, people are going to
    wonder why you’d want to teach in the first place. You need to be
    concrete here. I went perhaps a little overboard when I was on the
    market and I sketched out courses I would teach that I hadn’t taught
    (I already had a portfolio of core courses I had been the
    “instructor of record” for and so I could talk about those easily),
    but I do think having a solid idea of a course you would teach and
    how to structure it is more important than many candidates expect.

8.  Demonstrate *your trajectory*. Apply this idea to teaching
    especially. For example, the first time you teach it’s often
    overwhelming and you realize how much you don’t know. Talk about
    that, then tell me what you did to fix it. How did you change your
    practice? Similarly with research, you can demonstrate a clear
    trajectory and articulate how your work is unified in some capacity.
    Tell the story!

9.  Be prepared to answer basic questions of theory. If you’ve taught a
    course in topic X, I can feasibly ask you a question about that
    topic. Often I might ask a question that’s at the introductory-ish
    level, such as “Can you explain the intuition of MRS=MRT?” Or “What
    are income and substitution effects and why are they important?” I
    am not going to ask you to tell me about something you don’t claim
    you can teach, but if you tell me you’ve taught X, a basic idea from
    the set of ideas covered in X is fair game.

10. Show me you’re going to be a good citizen. Most people can’t be the
    asshole superstar researcher (this is less so for asshole superstar
    teachers, but can sometimes apply) and there are also costs to being
    that person. If in a one-on-one meeting or interview you come across
    as callous, uninterested, or unwilling to do the work the
    interviewers themselves are doing while interviewing you, they’re
    not going to be that likely to want to give you a job.

11. Prepare a good answer to the question of “fit” with the department.
    Do not, I repeat, do not, speak in broad generalities like
    “School/Dept X has such a great reputation and I would be happy to
    be at such a well known institution.” That tells me nothing. Is
    there anyone you’d like to work with? Did you take an even cursory
    look at our website? Did you notice courses you could teach or
    research units you could contribute to? We want to know you’re
    actually interested in coming to join us, so don’t say things you
    could say to people at any half-decent institution.

12. In teaching specialist roles, the department will often require you
    to do service from pretty early in your career. Have you thought
    about the kind of service or administrative role you can perform
    well? Come up with examples, even if you’re not sure of exactly what
    they would look like at the institution you’re interviewing at. Ask
    questions about this if you’re not sure what to ask about at the end
    of the interview. If you have ideas for things you want to do, then
    speak about them.

13. One form of service many schools need is for you to advise students.
    Can you handle that? Can you role-play different situations? For
    example, I have asked candidates, “A student comes to you during
    office hours and they’re struggling with one of their classes. What
    would you do with this student?” This is an opportunity for you to
    demonstrate that you can think through *how to diagnose a problem*.
    But the “problem” in this case is many-fold. The word “struggle” is
    purposefully ambiguous: *you* need to diagnose whether the student
    has challenges with the content, challenges in their personal life,
    challenges with the classroom ecology (maybe there’s an HR issue
    even). How would you go about finding out what kind of problem it
    is? Having uncovered the particular challenge, how would you deal
    with it?

14. What are your plans for your scholarship? When I ask this question I
    both mean your disciplinary research in economics, but also what
    kinds of things you might want to study in economics education,
    pedagogy, content, or service. For example, I have done work on data
    literacy in economic development, on teaching with students as
    partners, and more (including writing a textbook). This is separate
    from my disciplinary research in behavioral economics, economic
    development, and other applied topics. You should be able to talk
    coherently about your disciplinary research, but if you have other
    broad ideas, then let us know about those too.

15. Be aware that different institutions have different names for things
    you already know and understand. As someone who has taught in three
    different countries, I’m aware of the ways in which institutions
    have institution-specific names for roles, service, or ideas that
    are much more universal in higher education. So, if you get asked
    “How would you do \[X\] at our institution?” And you have no clue
    what the interview panel means by that, then be confident that you
    are allowed and in fact encouraged to ask follow up questions. For
    example, we have a term in the UK for a role called “Personal
    tutor”. You might think that this means you’re meant to give a
    student one-on-one lessons for a course, but the idea is that you
    play a mixture of roles of academic advisor, pastoral care, and
    person who helps a student when they don’t understand something.
    Many ideas like this exist, so be sure to ask questions and
    interrogate a panel if an idea isn’t clearly conveyed to you in an
    interview.

16. Don’t assume all members of the interview panel have read your JMP.
    At least one will have, but you can’t assume all members of the
    panel know your research well.

17. Therefore practice explaining your research to *non-specialists*. If
    there are important ideas someone needs to know to understand what
    you do in your field, try to explain those ideas as you would to an
    economist who is interested in what you do, but doesn’t know. Do not
    assume the panel is going to know an abstruse part of environmental
    economics or behavioral economics. Many don’t. Don’t make your
    interviewers feel stupid.

18. I will often ask you, “How would you explain \[X\] in your JMP?”, or
    “How would you explain your JMP to an interested undergraduate?” Or
    “How would you *change* the explanation you just gave to me \[aka
    someone with a PhD in economics\] if I asked you to explain it to an
    engaged undergraduate student?” with the follow-up “Why would you
    make that change?” I find answers to these questions help me to
    understand someone’s approach to teaching and to research.

19. When people ask questions about your papers/JMP, realize that they
    will be evaluating how you answer questions not only for how smart
    you are or how well you know your topic, but for whether you could
    teach that topic to students. Do you treat the questioner with
    respect? Do you take time to clarify what they asked (which
    especially with zoom lag and crappy mics may be helpful)? Do you
    answer with clarity and care?

20. Read your audience. Don’t ramble when you answer a question.
    Consider leaving a gap for questions at specific points and ask your
    audience/interviewers “Do you have any (follow-up) questions about
    X?”

21. Demonstrate *your trajectory*. Apply this idea to teaching
    especially. For example, the first time you teach it’s often
    overwhelming and you realize how much you don’t know. Talk about
    that, then tell me what you did to fix it. How did you change your
    practice? Similarly with research, you can demonstrate a clear
    trajectory and articulate how your work is unified in some capacity.
    Tell the story. Also, practice your story! Write it out and read it
    out loud. If something sounds off when you read it, it will sound
    off in an interview.

22. Be prepared to answer basic questions of theory. If you’ve taught a
    course in topic X, I can (and likely will) ask you a question about
    that topic. Often I might ask a question that’s at the
    introductory-ish level, such as “Can you explain the intuition of
    MRS=MRT?” Or “What are income and substitution effects and why are
    they important?” I am not going to ask you to tell me about
    something you don’t claim you can teach, but if you tell me you’ve
    taught X, a basic idea from the set of ideas covered in X is fair
    game. (I have seen people crash and burn when claiming they could
    teach course X and then an panelist asks them about an idea in X and
    they can’t explain it).

23. Show me you’re going to be a good citizen. Most people can’t be the
    asshole superstar researcher (this is less so for asshole superstar
    teachers, but can sometimes apply) and there are also costs to being
    that person. If in a one-on-one meeting or interview you come across
    as callous, uninterested, or unwilling to do the work the
    interviewers themselves are doing while interviewing you, they’re
    not going to be that likely to want to give you a job.

24. Prepare a good answer to the question of “fit” with the department.
    Do not, I repeat, do not, speak in broad generalities like
    “School/Dept X has such a great reputation and I would be happy to
    be at such a well known institution.” That tells me nothing. Is
    there anyone you’d like to work with? Did you take an even cursory
    look at our website? Did you notice courses you could teach or
    research units you could contribute to? We want to know you’re
    actually interested in coming to join us, so don’t say things you
    could say to people at any half-decent institution.

25. In teaching specialist roles, the department will often require you
    to do service from pretty early in your career. Have you thought
    about the kind of service or administrative role you can perform
    well? Come up with examples, even if you’re not sure of exactly what
    they would look like at the institution you’re interviewing at or
    when people ask “what questions do you have for us?” you can ask
    about what service/administration tends to look like and the kinds
    of roles that might work for you.

26. Many schools need you to do advising, for example. Can you handle
    that? Can you role-play different situations? For example, I have
    asked candidates, “A student comes to you during office hours and
    they’re struggling with one of their classes. What would you do with
    his student?” This is an opportunity for you to demonstrate that you
