## Week 1: Introduction 

### Thursday 7 September

- What is *Economics* about? How does it inform policy?
- What is *Behavioral* Economics about? How might *it* inform policy?
- The results of in-class question about behavioral economics will appear here 

<!--

Read

- Behavioral Economics for Kids [here](https://moodle.smith.edu/mod/resource/view.php?id=233702)
- Alm, James, 2017, "[Presidential Address: Is economics useful for public policy](https://moodle.smith.edu/mod/resource/view.php?id=233701)", *Southern Economic Journal*, 83 (4), 835–854 (16 pages)
    - Why read this? I want to convince you, first, that economics itself is useful for informing policy decisions and, second, that behavioral economics is at least as useful too in informing policy-makers on how to construct policy too. But, we mustn't throw out the baby with the bathwater: "economics" and "behavioral economics" must be used appropriately. 

Recommended

- The Behavioral Economics Guide 2016, available [here](https://moodle.smith.edu/mod/resource/view.php?id=233703). 
> The BE Guide is useful for you to get a broad sense of what we do in Behavioral Econ and what kinds of ideas you might want to research in your team project.

### Thursday 10 September
Today we shall do an experiment and (if there's time) begin to talk about using R. 

- Go to VEconLab here: [http://veconlab.econ.virginia.edu/login.htm](http://veconlab.econ.virginia.edu/login.htm)
- I will give you details on this page that you can use to log in. 

Read

Revision

- BFH, Chapter 1. 

Experiment Reports

- Guidelines for the reports are available here: [exp_reports](exp_reports)
<!--
The graph from the experiment is here: [drive.google.com/file/d/0B17bVUW1HMv-cUhfNkItNjlfU00/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B17bVUW1HMv-cUhfNkItNjlfU00/view?usp=sharing)
- The data are available in a google spreadsheet here: [docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10xzCd49nOEMDbxmegCfBaFZLz1uYE0ry7zGMBljEUcg/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10xzCd49nOEMDbxmegCfBaFZLz1uYE0ry7zGMBljEUcg/edit?usp=sharing)
- The data currently have a 'filter' in the first row and they are filtered on the individual ID codes (1 through 28). You can find your ID code and use the ID code to check what behavior you adopted, i.e. your bid or ask. Your cumulative earnings are also recorded. 
- Screenshots of the instructions are available in a zipped file here: [drive.google.com/file/d/0B17bVUW1HMv-Vk9PUjZ3WUhlS0U/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B17bVUW1HMv-Vk9PUjZ3WUhlS0U/view?usp=sharing).

and here: [https://moodle.smith.edu/mod/resource/view.php?id=46744](https://moodle.smith.edu/mod/resource/view.php?id=46744)

Team Projects

- I want you to emphasize the following steps: 
    - making sure you have *data* to work with (to bring to later Thursday sessions) 
    - deciding on the literature with which your project fits to produce a *literature review*
    - (much later) thinking about the ways in which you can alter/improve on the existing experiments/surveys to improve our overall knowledge


### ggplot Exercise
We are going to do an exercise where we use ggplot to try to reproduce at least one graphic from a published paper. The paper is: 

- Sutter, Matthias. 2009. "[Individual Behavior and Group Membership: Comment](https://moodle.smith.edu/mod/resource/view.php?id=233834)" American Economic Review, 99(5): 2247-57.
- download the paper from Moodle here: [https://moodle.smith.edu/mod/resource/view.php?id=46730](https://moodle.smith.edu/mod/resource/view.php?id=46730)
- see the paper's page at the AER here: [https://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/aer.99.5.2247&fnd=s](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/aer.99.5.2247&fnd=s)
- download the data on Moodle here: [https://moodle.smith.edu/mod/folder/view.php?id=46728](https://moodle.smith.edu/mod/folder/view.php?id=46728)
- see the online appendix for the paper here: [https://www.aeaweb.org/aer/data/feb2013/20101542_app.pdf](https://www.aeaweb.org/aer/data/feb2013/20101542_app.pdf)

Working with the data: 

- You will notice that the data is *not* glyph-ready and it also isn't that *tidy*. 
- Ideally, we would work with the spreadsheet as is and import it into R. We're not going to do that, but will create different spreadsheets with different data and *then* import them into R. 
- Check out the Tier protocol for suggestions. 
- Put the original data in an 'original data' folder. 
- Then create a folder with 'Working data' 
- We will use the data in working data and document what we do in a readme.txt file. 

Also, check out these links for behavioral econ in the press:

## Week 8: Group Interactions

 
### Tuesday 24 October

Read

- Cartwright, Chapter 6 up to 6.5 but **excluding** 6.2.2 and 6.2.5 (the math is tough). 
- Gary Charness and Matthias Sutter, 2012, "[Groups make better self-interested decisions](https://moodle.smith.edu/mod/resource/view.php?id=233863)," *Journal of Economic Perspectives*, 26 (3): 157-176 (18 pages)


### Thursday 26 October

- You can look at all the steps we'll take with the Sutter data here: 
[http://simondhalliday.github.io/eco254/fall_2015/activities/sutter/sutter_analysis_2](http://simondhalliday.github.io/eco254/fall_2015/activities/sutter/sutter_analysis_2)
 - We will look at the Wilcoxon test on Thursday as well as the a first attempt at a multiple regression model (my notes may change between now and then)
 - We shall complete Chapter 5 (leaving out signalling games)
 - Remember, I announced that we'll exclude Ch. 6 and skip to Ch. 7
 
### Experiment 3
 
 - If we have time, we'll do Experiment 3 (or I'll leave the rest of Ch. 5 for next week). 
 - Go to VEconLab here: http://veconlab.econ.virginia.edu/login.htm
 

- Be sure to have gone through the ggplot exercise that we started on last week Thursday. 
- You can see my 'readme.txt' file here: [http://simondhalliday.github.io/eco254/fall_2015/activities/sutter/readme.txt](http://simondhalliday.github.io/eco254/fall_2015/activities/sutter/readme.txt)
- You can see a step-by-step completion of the first part of the exercise in R here: [http://simondhalliday.github.io/eco254/fall_2015/activities/sutter/sutter_analysis](http://simondhalliday.github.io/eco254/fall_2015/activities/sutter/sutter_analysis)
- Once we've completed this exercise, I'll get started on Ch. 5 of Cartwright. 
- Then we'll spend a bit of time on group-work too. 

`ggplot` exercise continued: 

- you're first going to need to make the data narrow using a key-value pair
- you'll then need to filter out data that you don't need for the first graph in the paper (i.e. you only want "teamtreat" and "individuals")
    - to do this, you'll need to use "logical operators". 
    - A logical operator is like an "and" sign "&"" or an "or" sign "|"
    - you'll need to use or "|" because you'll want to *keep* those observations in "teamtreat" or "individual"
- once you've filtered out the treatments you don't need, you can construct the ggplot code
